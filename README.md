- 👋 Hi, I’m @LadyAliela
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and artificial intelligence
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything from scratch as I come from a finance background
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to predictive modelling and data visualization
- ⚡ Fun fact: The financial industry was one of the earliest adopters of artificial intelligence and data science, using algorithms to predict stock prices as early as the 1980s 😄
